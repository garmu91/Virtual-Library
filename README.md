Interactive Book Catalog (AJAX/JSON)
Development of an interactive front-end platform for displaying book information.
The system uses AJAX and JSON data manipulation for asynchronous catalog loading.
I implemented real-time filtering logic by genre and a dynamic interface (flip card effect on hover), with Day/Night Mode functionality to optimize the user experience (UX).
Work In Progress!
